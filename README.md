# Embedded-Jetty-Server-with-Redis

A simple server-side code that caches the last post from an IP address in the In-memory REDIS Cache. The GET operation also fetches the cached data. The Redis server needs to be running before the Java server is started.

A working jar file is also uploaded. Usage : $java -jar simpleserver.jar
